# Amazon_Sales_Project_Python 

This project was created by me using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It is an Amazon Sales Analysis project.

To begin, I imported the necessary Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Using Pandas, I loaded the dataset from local storage.

I explored the dataset by checking the number of rows and columns, and then displayed the first and last five rows. I examined the column data types and counted the number of unique values in each column.

Next, I cleaned the dataset by:

Dropping unused columns

Identifying and removing null values

Changing data types where necessary

Renaming columns for better clarity

After cleaning, I summarized the dataset to understand the distribution and key metrics.

For the analysis and visualization:

I identified the most frequently purchased product sizes using a bar chart.

Displayed the number of products shipped via courier with another bar chart.

Highlighted the most purchased products using a histogram.

Showed the distribution of customers (regular vs B2B buyers) using a pie chart.

Visualized the most purchased products by size using a scatter plot.

Displayed the top 10 states with the highest number of customers using a bar chart.

Finally, I concluded the analysis by summarizing key insights and patterns found in the sales data.
